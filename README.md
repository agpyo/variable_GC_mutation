# variable_GC_mutation

## Hardware requirements
Standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user is needed.
## Software requirements
The development version is tested on macOS (Sequoia 15.2) using matLAB_R2024b. In order to run the simulation code, compatibility of the operating system with MATLAB is required.
## Results
Simulation results generated using [simulation code](agent_sim.m) for [constant mutation rate](/cnt_sim) and [variable mutation rate](/var_sim).
